--do not publish on those data

QUESTIONS: 

Sources: Where is this data coming from?

How often is this data updated?

Is there PII we should be concerned about?

Do blanks represent "No's"? --blanks represent unknowns

Are states mutually exclusive from cities, e.g., NYC and NY? --duplicates possible

Are all entries/rows a different COVID+ person?

Hospital discharge info is largely missing. Are hospitalized cases (entries) always discharged, either through recovery or death, or do some entries represent current patients?

Can we parse out the "other disease" and "other conditions" categories?

NOTES:

--remove pregnancies --> confounding factor

--exclude medcond_yn --> confounding factor, overlaps with other conditions, thus creating large dip @ 1 comorbidity mark, basically saying people have either 0 or 2,3,4,etc. comorbidities.

--Discharge dates largely incomplete and would erase all our data if we removed based on this factor

--problems with mechvent_duration numbers, min/hours/days? mean 329, max 3M

--missing data is often significant portion, currently ignored, meaning, e.g., missing death data is neither counted as dead or alive

CORRECTIONS:

--force HOSP as "Yes" if ICU is "Yes"

--force HOSP and ICU as "Yes" if MECHVENT is "Yes"
