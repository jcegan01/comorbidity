NOTES:

--remove pregnancies --> confounding factor

--exclude medcond_yn --> confounding factor, overlaps with other conditions, thus creating large dip @ 1 comorbidity mark, basically saying people have either 0 or 2,3,4,etc. comorbidities.

--Discharge dates largely incomplete and would erase all our data if we removed based on this factor

--problems with mechvent_duration numbers, min/hours/days? mean 329, max 3M

--missing data is often significant portion, currently ignored, meaning, e.g., missing death data is neither counted as dead or alive
